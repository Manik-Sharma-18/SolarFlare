# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** Transform the model from near-persistence predictions into a genuine temporal forecaster with strong flare detection
**Current focus:** Phase 7 - Evaluation Metrics

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 11 (Evaluation Metrics)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-07 — Roadmap created for v3.0 milestone (phases 7-11)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

- [v3.0 roadmap]: Metrics first (Phase 7), then loss (8), training (9), architecture (10), integration (11) -- you cannot improve what you cannot measure, and loss fixes must precede architecture scaling
- [v3.0 research]: All features use PyTorch built-ins; no new dependencies required

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Known quirk: predictor forward() double-preprocess when downsample_input=False
- MPS runtime validation deferred (no CI hardware)
- [Research]: Optimal loss term weights (temporal_diff, temporal_var, asymmetric_alpha) unknown -- determine empirically during Phase 8
- [Research]: Overfitting risk with 4x parameter increase on 568 samples -- monitor train-val gap in Phase 10, fallback to [24,48,96] channels
